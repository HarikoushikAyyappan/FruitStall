JSP:
   *It is  a technology used to create web application like servlet technology but it provides more features than
   Servlet technology.
   *JSP tags are easier to maintain than HTML tags and provides additional features such as Expression language,JSTL etc..
   *The Lifecycle of JSP is,
      *Translation of JSP Page
      *Compilation of JSP Page
      *Classloading (the classloader loads class file)
      *Instantiation (Object of the Generated Servlet is created).
      *Initialization ( the container invokes jspInit() method).
      *Request processing ( the container invokes _jspService() method).
      *Destroy ( the container invokes jspDestroy() method).
      JSP API:
      * JSP API consists of two packages:
            javax.servlet.jsp
            javax.servlet.jsp.tagext
      *The javax.servlet.jsp package has two interfaces and classes.The two interfaces are:
                  JspPage
                  HttpJspPage
        The classes are :
             JspWriter
             PageContext
             JspFactory
             JspEngineInfo
             JspException
             JspError
      *All the generated servlet claases must implement JSP Page interface and JSP Page interface implements Servlet
      interface.
      *public void jspInit()&public void jspDestroy() are the methods of JSP page interface and public void _jspService()
      is the method of Http page Interface.
     JSP Scripting elements:
       * Java code is inserted into jsp page using Scripting elements.
          The Scripting elements are scriptlet tag
                                     expression tag
                                     declaration tag
       *JSP Scriplet tag:
        It is used to execute java source code in JSP,
       Syntax:
       <%  java source code %>
       *Expression Tag:
        Expression Tag is mainly used to print the values of variable or method.
        Syntax:
        <%=  statement %>
      *JSP Declaration Tag:
      *It is used to declare Fields and Methods.
      *The code inside Declaration tag is kept outside service() method of auto generated servlet so that it does not get
      memory at each request.
     *Scriplet Tag declares only fields but Declaration Tag declares both methods and fields.The Scriplet tag is present
     inside Service() method but Declaration tag is present outside Service() method.
     *JSP Implicit Objects:
       *There are 9 implicit objects in jsp:
       *JSP Request implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of Http servlet request.
         *It is used to get request information such as parameter,server name,server port,remote address,header information,
         content type,character encoding etc..
       *JSP Servlet Response:
         *It is an implicit object of Http servlet response.
         *It is used to send response such as redirect response to another resource ,send error etc..
       *JSP Servlet Config:
         *It is an implicit object of Servlet Config.
         *it is used to get initialization parameter for a particular Jsp Page.Generally it is used to get initialization
         parameter from web.xml file.
       *JSP Application implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of Servlet Context.
         *It is created only once when the application is deployed in server.
         *Used to get,set or remove attribute from the application scope and used to get initialization parameter from
         configuration file(web.xml).
       *JSP Session implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of type Http Session.
         *It is used to set,get or remove attribute or get session information.
       *JSP Pagecontext implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of Page context class.
         *It is used to get,set,remove attributes from the following scopes
             *Session
             *Application
             *Page
             *Request
       *Page implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of type Object class,it is written as Object page = this;
         *To use this, it must be cast to servlet class.eg.<% (HttpServlet)page.log("message"); %>
         *It is used less because we can use directly in jsp page like this <% this.log("message"); %>
       *Exception implicit object:
         *It is an implicit object of java.lang.Throwable class.
         It is used to print exception but it is used in error pages.
