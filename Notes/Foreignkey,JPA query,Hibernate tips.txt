ForeignKey:
* Foreignkey is used to link one or more tables together.
*It is also called Referencing key which links two tables by matching the primary key field of another table.
*It identifies each row of the table which is being referenced and maintains referential integrity in MySQL.
*Syntax:[CONSTRAINT constraint_name]
     FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)
     REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)
     ON DELETE referenceOption
     ON UPDATE referenceOption
*Creation of ForeignKey can be done by CREATE TABLE Query and ALTER TABLE Query.
*There are some Reference Options in Foreignkey syntax such as CASCADE,SETNULL,RESTRICT,NOACTION etc.
*CASCADE reference options automatically updates/deletes the modifications done in the parentrow.
*SETNULL makes the child row null when update/delete is done in the parent row.
*RESTRICT makes the updation and deletion process restricted.
*It is impossible to make updation or deletion to the child row and make modifications in parent row.
*The use of Foreign key sometimes makes updation and deletion process impossible because when the sql executes ALTER TABLE
  statement.It shows exception.To make it execute,"SET foreign_key_checks=0;" command is used but this command can be used
  in MySQL command line client and it is impoosible to do it using jpa query and the command is a temporary change maker so it can be used for
  a session.
 Hibernate tips:
 *The above stated disadvantage can be overcome using Hibernate .
 *It is possible to make a single entity map multiple tables using @SecondaryTable annotation which is a pseudo foreign key technique so insertion,
 updation,deletion process can be done easily.
 *We can make a single entity refer multiple tables and we can customize the foreign key specifications also.
 *It is required to define the fields of primary table using @coloumn annotation by providing corresponding coloumn name and
 define the fields of secondary table using @coloumn annotation with name of the table specified and generate getter and setter for
 all the fields.
