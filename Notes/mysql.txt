MYSQL database
*MYSQL  is a Relational Database Management System used to store and manipulate data which is in the form of tables,rows and coloumns
*MySQl is based on structured query language which is used for handling data.
*MYSQL is fast and it implements database operations on tables,rows ,coloumns and indexes.
*it allows us to obtain a relationship between rows and coloumns of various tables and it uses various sql queries to provide the end
user valuable information.
Working of MYSQL:
*MYSQL follows Client-Server Architecture.
*Core component of MYSQL is MYSQL Server .MYSQL creates a Database . Client gives request through Graphical User Interface.One of
GUI is MYSQL Workbench that we use.
*Server responds to the requests provided and provides the necessary output.
*Some of the advantages of MYSQL is *It is easy to use
                                    *It is fast and scalable
                                    *Easy to download and configure
                                    *Client-Server model
                                    *Platform independency and ability to be compatible with many Operating System
                                    *High performance in terms of memory efficiency etc..
Creating new Schema in Workbench:
*Schema can be created in two ways 1.By using command line client 2. using Workbench
*Using Workbench,Schema is created by clicking new schema in schema menu. After providing name of database, if we refresh, new schema
is created. In schema menu, we will be able to see the schema that we created. By clicking "i" near the name of schema ,we will be
knowing the details of schema. and we will have subgroups like Tables,views and functions etc under the schema that is created.
*we have commands like USE ,SHOW to work on the database that we created.
Creating new Table in Schema:
*Tables help organization of data into rows,coloumns and it stores and displays data in organized manner.
*A Table creation command requires 1.Name of the Table, 2.Name of Fields 3.Definition for each Fields.
*Creation of Table can be done in two ways
        1. By command line client
                    *The command CREATE TABLE is used to create table .
        Syntax:         CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
                        column_definition1,
                        column_definition2,
                        ........,
                        table_constraints
                    );
        *The database name should be unique, we will give name of the coloumns along with the datatype of th the coloumn
        , the table constraints specifies primarykey,Foreign key,Unique Key,Check etc.
                *Syntax of coloumn definition column_name1 data_type(size) [NULL | NOT NULL]
         * the command SHOW table_name and DESCRIBE table_name are used to bet insights about the table.
         2.Using Workbench
                    *By clicking on the schema that we created, it shows suboptions like tables ,views etc..From that click
                    Tables,Right click and select Create a table. Provide the name of the table,name of the coloumn along
                    with datatype and details about NOTNULL,Primary Key,AutoIncremental etc and click Apply and the table created
                    could be seen.
 MYSQL Queries:
        *some commonly used MYSQL Queries are INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ,DELETE which can be used with database,tables and records.
        *create database database_name;->creates a database
        *use database_name;->used to do create tables and other database objects.
        *SHOW DATABASES->shows the list of databases created.
        *MySQL create query->  used to create a table, view, procedure and function.
        *MySQL alter query -> is used to add, modify, delete or drop columns of a table.
                *Adding coloumn in the table:
                    Syntax: ALTER TABLE table_name
                           ADD new_column_name column_definition
                          [ FIRST | AFTER column_name ];
